# Papirus-blue theme

This is the papirus-blue theme for [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/).

## Getting started

To get started with theme development, this is what you'll need:

- [node.js](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)

If you're on Linux, you can simply run:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
```

Or if you're on OSX and got [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed:
```
brew install node
```

### Install the command line

We're going to use the official [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to run our development server.

Go ahead and install it:

```
sudo npm install -g resume-cli
```

### Work on your resume

If you don't already have your json resume you can make in online by visiting:
http://registry.jsonresume.org/
